# Thomas & Friends Puzzle Game

This project serves as an exploration of various Unity concepts through the development of a puzzle game. The game features three characters: Claire, Thomas, and John, each represented by a cuboid. The objective of each level is to align each character with their respective exit spots to progress to the next stage. The game comprises five increasingly challenging levels, each introducing new concepts and requiring the characters to cooperate to complete the level.

## Game Controls

- `1`, `2`, `3`: Switch between characters.
- `A`, `D`: Move left and right.
- `Space`: Jump.
- `Left` and `Right` arrows: Spin.
- `Backspace`: Reset the level.
- `ESC`: Exit the game.

## Level Descriptions

### Level 1: Basic Movement Mechanics
- Introduction to camera movement, player controls, character switching, and level completion mechanics.

### Level 2: Character-Specific Platforms
- Introduction to physics layers.
- Platforms change to match the color of the character and only collide with the designated character.

### Level 3: Enhanced Movement Mechanics
- Introduction to teleporters and moving platforms.

### Level 4: Interactive Elements
- Introduction to switches that can open doors or alter platform colors based on character interaction.

### Level 5: The Impossible Game
- Introduction to game obstacles such as traps, holes, and color-coded turrets (bullets only collide with characters of the same color).

The game is designed to provide a progressive learning experience, exploring different aspects of Unity with each level, and demanding a collaborative effort among characters to advance through the stages.
