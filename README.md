## Introduction

Welcome to my Unity learning journey! This repository is a collection of five demos/games I created while diving deep into the world of Unity. Each project represents a step in my journey, showcasing both my growth and the challenges I encountered along the way. From understanding basic game objects to grappling with 3D gaming and AI, these projects are a testament to my learning curve and my commitment to mastering Unity.

## What I learned

Throughout these projects, I've not only honed my Unity skills but also bridged my existing C++ knowledge with new C# concepts. Here are some key areas I plan to explore further:

- **Templates and Generic Methods:** Applying these to game development for versatile and efficient code.
- **State Machines:** Enhancing their robustness for more dynamic game flows.
- **Serialization:** A powerful tool I'm eager to utilize in future projects.
- **Design Patterns:** MVC/MVVM for structured and maintainable code.
- **Object Pooling:** For optimizing performance in game environments.
- **Scriptable Objects:** To create more modular and designer-friendly systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

These games were developed in Unity and are primarily designed for Ubuntu. To get started:

1. Clone the repository.
1. Run the executables to play each game.

On a side note, a couple of these games have a Windows .exe
